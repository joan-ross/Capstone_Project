# Capstone Pavement Project
Capstone project for the CodeYou: Data Analysis course.

This project aims to analyze the state of sidewalks and pavement in Bloomington, IN circa 2018
**Goal:**
 
 To analyze how the sidewalks and streets were being tended to at that time.

- I aimed to look at locations of sidewalks with poor conditions and see what caused the damage as well as the different types of sidewalks in Bloomington that were in poor condition.

**Steps:**
1. List/Research Data about the state and location of Bloomington sidewalks in 2018, which ones were repaired and tended to and if there is a correlation between the type of sidewalk and the damage/ distress on that type of sidewalk.
2. Review the available data
3. Identify what can be done, list what can be answered or said based on data reviewed
4. Clean the data
5. Analyze and ansewer questions
6. Visualize the data

## Getting Started
1. Clone this repo.
2. Create a virtual environment in the project folder by using `python3 -m venv venv` or `python -m venv venv`
3. install the packages listed in the `requirements.txt` file
4. Open the `src/Raw_Data_Explanation.ipynb` to view an explanation of the raw data
5. Open the `src/Clean_Data_Explanation.ipynb` to view a walkthrough of the clean data as well as a data visualization
6. The tableau folder has the tableau data visualization files. The following link will also take you to the visualization itself:
