# Capstone Sidewalk Project
Capstone project for the CodeYou: Data Analysis course.

This project aims to analyze the state of sidewalks and pavement in Bloomington, IN circa 2018
**Goal:**
 
 To analyze if the sidewalks and streets were being tended to at that time

- I aim to look at locations of sidewalks with poor conditions and cross reference it with their location to see if action was taken to keep up with the walkability of Bloomington.

**Steps:**
1. List/Research Data about the state and location of Bloomington sidewalks in 2018, which ones were repaired and tended to and if there is a correlation between the type of sidewalk and the damage/ distress on that type of sidewalk.
2. Review the available data
3. Identify what can be done, list what can be answered or said based on data reviewed
4. Clean the data
5. Analyze and ansewer questions
6. Visualize the data
